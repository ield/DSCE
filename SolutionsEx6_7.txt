1. No. It depends on the parameters of the functions.
2. Small values of u
3. Big values of u. I depends on the function.
4. The initial value is constant.
5. Because there can be different 'holes'.
6. u must be small enough for convergence and N big enough to let that convergence happen.
7. Depending on the function and parameters. With the appropriate parameters it converges to a minimum, not necessarily the absolute, that depends on the starting point.
8. Starting point and u.
9. Because the initial values are moved on the curve so the new convergence is at another place.
10. u is big enough so that when there is a very positive derivative of the function it can overcome the peak, so it does not converge.
